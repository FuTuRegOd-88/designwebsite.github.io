    <p class="cultureone">Tsaatan of Northern Mongolia</p>
    <p>
      The herdsmen go by the name Dukha. Herding was formerly an essential
      component of human existence, and it is from this that the Tsaatans of
      Northern Mongolia developed their rich and distinctive way of life. Since
      ancient times, the Tsaatan have dragged reindeer through the taiga, first
      in their native Tuva, a republic of Russia, and later, after borders were
      changed under Soviet influence in 1944, in Mongolia. The Tsaatan use
      reindeers to milk reindeer, make cheese, gather pine nuts, and sleep in
      traditional ortz tents, which are shaped like teepees. Only a few hundred
      people still lead a traditional lifestyle, but since search engines have
      made previously unreachable areas of our globe accessible, they have
      gained popularity. Adventure packages are offered by tour operators to the
      taiga, where guests can encounter Tsaatan daily life.

    <p class="culturetwo">Kalash of Chitral, Pakistan</p>
    <p>
      A group of three villages, hidden in the distant northwestern hills of
      Pakistan near the Afghan border, yet struggle to maintain their language
      and culture in the face of modernization and religious conversion. The
      troops of Alexander the Great's army who travelled through this area in
      324 BCE are thought to be the ancestors of the tribe known as the Kalash.
      Even while it has not yet been conclusively shown how these people, their
      language, attire, and their culture of nature worship—which stands in
      stark contrast to the Islamic civilization that surrounds them—evolved and
      endured throughout the centuries, many researchers dispute the claim. The
      population used to live a basic life, primarily reliant on agriculture and
      raising livestock. They practised a faith that was based on nature, which
      later academics compared to an animistic style of worship while others
      discovered parallels with prehistoric Hindu ideas. The Kalash adhere to a
      number of social rites and customs. One of them, which has received a lot
      of attention, is the practise of relegating menstruation and pregnant
      women to the "bashaleni," a dormitory-style structure located outside of
      the main village. The women take a break from their everyday
      responsibilities during the bashaleni time out. The communities of the
      Kalash people have also seen a rise in tourism. Tourists visit the area in
      the spring and summer (winter can be harsh) to view the breathtakingly
      untamed beauty of the landscape and the distinctive way of life of the
      Kalash people, unless political circumstances prevent them. The
      festivities are among the greatest times to visit the Kalash communities.
      Popular holidays include Choimus in December, Uchao in August, and Joshi
      (also known as Zoshi) in May.

    <p class="culturethree">The Loba of Mustang, Nepal</p>
    <p>
      Lo was taken by a neighbouring kingdom in the late eighteenth century, but
      both were swiftly incorporated into Nepal when Prithvi Narayan Shah, the
      monarch of one of the hill republics, sacked the others and united them to
      become the country of Nepal. Lo Monthang is not far from the Tibetan
      border. Mustang's art and culture survived the devastation of the Chinese
      invasion and the Cultural Revolution safely on the Nepali side of the
      divide.The majority of Loba are farmers, herders, or traders. Their houses
      are made of stone, and the roofs are squares of thinly carved stone. The
      roofs are exceptionally smooth and consistent, and a little square has
      been built in each corner to allow prayer flags to be hung there. To guard
      against the strong winds that sprint up the slopes, the majority of homes
      are constructed closely together and lack windows entirely, only having
      holes in the walls. Because of how strong these winds are, their homes are
      seldom constructed with the South in mind. Due to the absence of
      ventilation, this has the unfortunate side effect of making the houses
      extremely hot during the summer. People frequently doze off on patios
      during the summer because of this.It is common for a Loba woman to be
      married to several men, a practice known as polyandry. This is done
      because the Loba believe that there is less chance of a woman becoming a
      widow if she has many husbands. This is a unique feature of the Loba, but
      one that is slowly diminishing. The younger Loba want to discard it, but
      the older generation feels it is necessary.The Loba are very religious
      people. Two Buddhist sects, the Kargyupa and the Sakyapa, are dominant in
      upper Mustang. Gine, Gensu, Gelung, and Nayuene are the four main
      religious holidays observed by the Loba. One or two times a year, Nayuene
      is observed, and there are a number of guidelines that must be fulfilled.
      A 48-hour fast and a vow of complete silence are among these requirements.
      Additionally, they refrain from having sexual interactions at this period
      while giving to the needy and underprivileged.

    <p class="culturefour">Huaorani of Ecuador</p>
    <p>
      For hundreds of years, the Huaorani people have been living in the
      Ecuadorian Amazon as forest hunters and gatherers. The Huaorani, a
      somewhat isolated indigenous community living in Ecuador's eastern
      Amazonian region, number about 1,300 people. Seasons do not exist for the
      indigenous Huaorani people since they do not recognize time. genuinely
      live from day to day. They'll plan a feast together if they're feeling
      festive. The men in the tribes spend a few days hunting, perhaps for boars
      or monkeys—the latter of which is prized as a delicacy—as part of the
      preparations for the celebrations. The women will gather a variety of
      foods, including berries and other things. One particular item, Chicha, is
      specially prepared. A Huaorani treat is chick especially for special
      occasions. The yuca root is mashed and chewed to aid in the fermentation
      process. The Chicha ferments, adding alcohol; the longer it ferments, the
      more alcohol it will contain. As a result, the Chicha will have more time
      to "ripen" and will therefore contain more alcohol, for instance, if the
      males take longer to hunt. The women will cook the Chicha using chonta
      fruits rather than yuca if they are ripe. These unusual fruits, however,
      must first be collected because they are located high up in palm trees.
      Initially green, they become a lovely orange colour after being harvested.
      An upcoming wedding is one occasion for the Huaorani natives to feel
      pleased. The institution of marriage is highly valued and lavishly
      honoured in traditional Huaorani society. Can you picture truly savouring
      each day and not caring about the passing of time? The Huaorani culture
      provides a special window into how the world might have turned out and how
      it was thousands of years ago, before clocks were invented.

    <p class="culturefive">Dropkas of Ladakh</p>

    <p>
      The only real Indo Aryan tribe still existing in India, according to
      historians, has been living in the high altitudes of Ladak for the past
      2000 years. Drokpa tribe, which in Ladakhi means "white skin." These
      people stand out from the rest of the Tibeto-Burman group in Ladakh in
      terms of look, culture, language, and religious beliefs, and they have
      managed to maintain the purity of their race over the years. The Drokpa,
      also known as the Dard tribe, are dispersed over five villages to the
      southwest of Leh. These villages are notable for their picturesque
      settings, verdant valleys, temperate climate, and a bounty of agricultural
      products, including the best apples, apricots, walnuts, and grapes that
      the Drokpa people rely on for their livelihood. An agricultural and
      vegetarian society, the Dropkas. Kaltse, Domkhar, Skurbuchan, Achinathang,
      and Dha and Hanu are the names of these Indo Aryan villages. Only Dha and
      Hanu, which are known as the "Land of the Aryans," are accessible to
      tourists out of the entire group. Both men and women in the area have
      magnificent flower and bead headpieces, and the women are known as the
      "Flower Women of Ladakh." The inhabitants enjoy singing, dancing,
      drinking, and dressing up, and during the summer Banano Festival, men and
      women get together to sing and dance for three nights straight! While
      Buddhism is practised in Ladakh, the Dropkas practise Bon and Animism and
      have kept their rituals and traditions alive for centuries. Between the
      months of June and October, when temperatures are neither too high nor too
      low, is the ideal time to explore these picturesque settlements with the
      ancient Aryans.
